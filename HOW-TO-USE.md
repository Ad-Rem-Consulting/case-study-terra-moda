# How to use this template

This is the case-study scaffold for [Ad Rem](https://adrem.services). When a
client engagement ships and you want to document it publicly:

## 1. Create the case-study repo

Use the GitHub UI's "Use this template" button, or via gh CLI:

```bash
gh repo create Ad-Rem-Consulting/case-study-<slug> \
  --template Ad-Rem-Consulting/case-study-template \
  --public \
  --description "<client> — <one-line outcome>"
```

Slug convention: `case-study-<client-or-project-shortname>`. Examples:
- `case-study-acme-portal`
- `case-study-bookings-tool`
- `case-study-nps-dashboard`

## 2. Fill in README.md

Replace every `{{handlebar}}` placeholder with real content, including
the `<!-- ad-rem-case-study: ... -->` HTML comment block at the very top
of the file. That block is the canonical metadata for this case study —
the same values you fill in there will be copied into the Website's
content collection in step 4, so getting it right once here saves
hunting through section headings later.

Sections in order of writing difficulty (easiest first):
1. **Front-matter HTML comment block** — just data, no prose
2. **Stack** — just list what you used
3. **Timeline & engagement shape** — facts
4. **The problem** — what motivated the work
5. **What we built** — what you actually did
6. **Outcome** — the hardest section, because it requires post-launch data

If outcome data isn't available yet, ship the case study without it and add
a *"Results pending — final report due {{date}}"* note. Update the repo
when the data lands.

## 3. Add screenshots

Drop 2-4 PNGs into `screenshots/`. Compress to ~150KB each (Squoosh or
similar). Caption each one in the README so a visitor scrolling through
can follow the story without clicking the images.

## 4. Surface it on adrem.services

The Website uses Astro Content Collections (not a TS data file). Two
pieces need to land in the Website repo:

**(a)** Drop a new markdown file at `Website/src/content/case-studies/<slug>.md`.
The filename (minus `.md`) becomes the URL slug — the page renders at
`/work/<slug>`. The YAML frontmatter must match the Zod schema in
`Website/src/content/config.ts`:

````markdown
---
client: Acme Industries
project: Customer Portal Rebuild
outcome: 60% reduction in support tickets in Q1.
stack:
  - Next.js
  - Postgres
  - Vercel
repoUrl: https://github.com/Ad-Rem-Consulting/case-study-acme-portal
liveUrl: https://acme-portal.example.com    # omit the field entirely if private
year: 2026
thumbnail: /case-studies/acme-portal-home.jpg
timeline: 6 weeks
engagement: Fixed-price
order: 3                                     # lower numbers surface first
---

Mirror the body of the case-study repo's README here (without the
`<!-- ad-rem-case-study: ... -->` HTML comment header — the YAML
frontmatter above replaces it on the Website side).
````

**(b)** Drop the thumbnail at `Website/public/case-studies/<slug>-<name>.jpg`.
The path must match the `thumbnail` field above. Keep file size around
~150–200KB.

**(c)** Push the `Website` repo. Vercel watches the Website repo directly
and rebuilds on push to `main`. The new card surfaces in the homepage's
Selected Work section and the detail page renders at `/work/<slug>`.

## 5. Delete this HOW-TO-USE.md from the new repo

It's only here in the template; case-study repos shouldn't carry it.
